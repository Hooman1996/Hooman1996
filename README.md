- 👋 Hi, I’m Hooman Aghalou, a MSc student of remote sensing and photogrammetry at K. N. Toosi university of technology in Tehran/Iran.
- Im :
   -    Experienced in different concepts of remote sensing and working with different multispectral and hyperspectral sensors, and 
 familiar with the concepts of precision agriculture and applications of remote sensing in this area such as soil and plant monitoring.
   -    Skilled in working with neural networks, machine learning and deep learning algorithms and familiar with application of artificial intelligence in remote sensing projects.
   -    Skilled in using libraries and tools related to artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning in python such as : Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Tensorflow and Keras.
   -    Skilled in Python, Git, Matlab, Envi and Microsoft office.
   -    Able to speak in Persian, English, Azeri and Turkish Languages.
 
 - 🏅 Achievments: 
    - Taking classes and courses related to remote sensing, artificial intelligence and programming and receiving a high-grade.
    - Obtaining the rank of 14 out of 8 to 15 thousands in master's entrance exam.
    
- 👀 I’m interested in : 
     - AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, Computer vision and their usecases in RS.
     - Precision agriculture.
     - Datascience.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently a  remote sensing and photogrammetry engineer in a Remote sensing / AI based company,
      and working on my matser's thesis at the same time, about estimation of soil properties using neural networks and satellite imagery after removing the soil moisture effect. .
